This SharedFiles Folder is made to hold the utility function and a .json file. 

The first file is called LibraryData.json. 
This file contains all data about each library which will be used in many other folders whenever Library Data is needed. 
To add a new library, simply see the main Readme.md file for instructions. 

The second file is called utility_tool.py. 
It is a simple code with a single function called read_json_file()
This function reads the first file, LibraryData.json and returns a list of dictionaries (where each dictionary corresponds to an entire library). 

This folder is used in every single metric.
