#Description:
# - Extracts the Issue Closing Time (in days) of a library based on its Github repository.
#
#Requirements: 
# - You will need to install PyGithub
# - You will need to input your Github credentials to make use of the Github API
#Input:
# - A file with the library repository names (repositories.txt)
#Output:
# - A line with the the average Issue Closing Time in days for each repository in
#   repositories.txt in the following format (printed to stdout):
#[repository] - Issue Closing Time: [average number of days]
#How to run: 
# - Just run the script with repositories.txt in the same directory.
