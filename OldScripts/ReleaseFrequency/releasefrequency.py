# Description:
# - Obtains the Release Frequency (in days) of a library based on its Github repository.
#
#Requirements: 
# - You will need to install PyGithub
# - You will need to input your Github credentials to make use of the Github API
#Input:
# - A file with the library repository names (repositories.txt)
#Output:
# - A line will be printed to stdout for each of the libraries in repositories.txt with the following format:
#[library] - Release Frequency: [release frequency in average number of days]
#How to run: 
# - Just run the script with repositories.txt in the same directory.
